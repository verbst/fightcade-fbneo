// Groovy MiSTer - the sender: session lifecycle, per-frame blit, audio, and raster pacing.
//
// This header is what FBNeo sees. It exposes NO socket types and pulls in no system headers:
// groovymister.h (and its <winsock2.h>) is confined to groovy_output.cpp, because
// src/burner/win32/main.cpp includes the Winsock 1.1 <winsock.h> and MSVC will not tolerate
// both in one translation unit. See src/dep/groovymister/PROVENANCE.md.
//
// Include AFTER burner.h (needs INT32 / INT16 / TCHAR).

// Per-frame hooks

// Called at the end of VidDoFrame(), once the finished frame is sitting in pVidImage.
// Opens the session lazily on first use, applies a CmdSwitchres when the geometry changes,
// packs the frame and blits it. Safe (and cheap) to call when Groovy is disabled.
//
// Placed in the video path deliberately: GGPO re-simulates rolled-back frames through
// RunFrame(0,0,0), which never calls VidFrame(), so a hook here cannot see a rolled-back
// frame. Same for auto-frameskip mid-frames and netplay skip frames.
void GroovyFrameReady();

// Called from RunIdle(). True when the MiSTer raster should be the frame clock, i.e. when
// FBNeo's own timeGetTime() limiter must stand down. Exactly one pacer, never both.
bool GroovyPacingActive();

// Blocks until the right moment to start the next frame, using the ACK stream to close the
// loop against the real CRT raster.
//
// On Windows this is ALSO the only thing that drains the RIO send-completion queue, so it
// must be called every iteration while connected - including frames where nothing was
// blitted. Skipping it fills the 846-entry queue within a few frames, after which sends fail
// silently and it looks like a dead core.
void GroovyWaitSync();

// The app-master counterpart of GroovyWaitSync(), for when something ELSE owns the frame
// clock - i.e. netplay, where GGPO must stay the clock and starving ggpo_idle is not an
// option (rollbacks and packet transmission both happen inside it).
//
// Call once per displayed frame from the stock RunIdle path, immediately after VidPaint(3).
// No-op when Groovy is pacing, so it and GroovyWaitSync() are mutually exclusive by
// construction. See the implementation for why it costs almost nothing.
void GroovyFrameSync();

// Mirror one frame's audio to the MiSTer. pPcm is signed 16-bit LE interleaved stereo -
// exactly what FBNeo already produces - and nSamples is nBurnSoundLen (sample frames, not
// bytes). No-op unless audio is enabled and the core reports it accepted audio.
//
// Takes a NON-const pointer because in "MiSTer only" mode it also silences the host buffer
// in place, so the policy lives here rather than leaking into run.cpp. Silencing rather
// than skipping AudSoundFrame() keeps the DirectSound clock running, which AudSoundCheck()
// depends on. The mute only happens when audio is genuinely reaching the MiSTer - a dead
// or refused stream must never leave the user with no sound at all.
//
// Call it BEFORE AudSoundFrame(): DxSoundFrame() applies the optional low-pass DSP to this
// same buffer in place, and the MiSTer should get the emulator's output, not a filtered copy.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Lifecycle
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Hold an idle session open against the core's idle timeout (OSD: Server -> Idle timeout, 5s by
// default). Sends a 1-byte CMD_GET_STATUS, but ONLY once nothing has gone on the wire for a couple
// of seconds - so during emulation, where every blit counts as activity, it sends nothing at all.
//
// Call it OFTEN and cheaply: it is gated internally on elapsed time, and the caller's polling rate
// must be faster than that gate or the worst-case silence roughly doubles. The WM_TIMER in
// scrn.cpp drives it at 250ms, which is what covers Win32 menus and modal dialogs - the cases
// where FBNeo's frame loop stops entirely and the core would otherwise drop us.
//
// No-op when no session is open, or after a deliberate close.
void GroovyKeepAlive();

// Tear the session down. Idempotent, safe even if no session was ever opened, and safe to
// call from any exit path including ones that run more than once.
//
// Sends CMD_CLOSE by plain sendto BEFORE tearing the RIO queues down, because the client's
// own CmdClose() loses that race on Windows and leaves the core displaying the final frame
// forever instead of returning to connection-search.
//
// pszReason is recorded in the log so a shutdown says which path it came from - window close,
// match end, driver exit or process exit. Keep this FAST: on the MENU_QUIT path it runs
// inside DrvExit(), ahead of the ggpo_close_session() that reports the match result.
void GroovySessionClose(const char* pszReason = 0);

// True once CmdInit + CmdSwitchres have succeeded and frames are going out.
bool GroovyIsStreaming();

// Does a Groovy session want the emulation rendered at 32bpp?
//
// Consulted by dx9AltTextureInit(), which currently hardcodes 16bpp. Deliberately does NOT
// depend on the session being open - the depth is decided during VidInit(), long before the
// first frame opens the session - so this answers "do we intend to stream RGB888", not
// "are we streaming".
bool GroovyWants32Bit();

// Should the host's own vsync be suppressed?
//
// True whenever we intend to stream. With host vsync on, Present() blocks on the PC
// monitor's vblank while GroovyWaitSync() blocks on the CRT's raster - two clocks beating
// against each other, which is the one thing 7.1 says never to do. Like GroovyWants32Bit(),
// this is consulted when the D3D device is created (long before a session exists), so it
// answers "do we intend to pace" rather than "are we pacing".
